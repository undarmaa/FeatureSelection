global mail fraud The government says PacNet part international network that has stolen hundreds millions dollars from millions elderly victims Details the various law enforcement actions are still developing but CNNMoney has exclusively confirmed that Canadian payment processor named PacNet key target this crackdown the Treasury Department has deemed PacNet significant transnational criminal organization landing the same short list some the world most notorious mobsters drug cartels and murderers another action the government seizing PacNet funds held bank alleging that PacNet used the

raking more than million year from victims And was using PacNet process these payments PacNet the payment processor choice many mass mail fraud schemes Postal Inspector wrote court filing Thursday Friday PacNet denied the allegations post its and said has decided stop processing payments for direct mail companies absolutely and categorically reject the allegations made against regarding our

mere association created the article will enough for banks and other financial institutions worldwide immediately close the Company financial accounts and will make impossible for the Company establish new banking relationships Tom Clare attorney representing PacNet wrote letter CNN general counsel Any article regarding the misuse payment processing services fraudsters must not name otherwise identify PacNet But even before our investigation began the Iowa Attorney General had already connected PacNet all kinds scams The agency told that while PacNet had claimed review the mailings sent clients the one mailing obtained from PacNet own files via subpoena was deceptive sweepstakes ruse further indicator that PacNet was aware the key role was playing supporting mail fraud schemes that victimize the elderly PacNet attorney said had cooperated willingly with Iowa investigation and that PacNet did not have copies any the mailings the agency was specifically investigating And was adamant that the company has never knowingly processed payments for scams PacNet has consistently and unequivocally stated that has never continued process payments for any promotion that knew deceptive said course not everyone using payment processor scammer There are perfectly legitimate reasons company could turn payment processor such easier access the banking system lower fees and global reach But there are plenty illicit reasons well Here how works help shield their operations from authorities fraudsters need way process payments that won easily link them their scheme raise red flags That because many banks will shut down account report them authorities they detect suspicious activity like high number small deposits complaints refunds con artists and other schemers instead turn payment processor like PacNet PacNet has relationships with banks around the world and can set accounts for clients the countries they business processing payments currencies ranging from the British Pound the Indonesian Rupiah This gives fraudsters the key ability access victims and bank accounts countries far from their home base Say your grandmother who suffers from Alzheimer gets letter telling her she won million and all she needs send claim this life changing prize The letter looks official she gets out her checkbook and mails that Payments like these often end with PacNet PacNet then deposits the money into account under its own name and takes cut commission holds the rest the funds until they are eventually sent the client own bank account typically through wire transfer There are many layers that victims typically have idea that PacNet involved except rare cases where frustrated family members have found fine print the back the canceled checks and traced the deposits back PacNet California resident Jennifer Bell for example only recently noticed that handful checks sent three different schemes that she saved from her elderly relative digital bank records were all stamped with PacNet name The year old woman who Bell says was struggling with dementia the time had sent tens thousands dollars all kinds different scams Bell and other family members realized how bad the situation had gotten when they learned she had drained the entire balance the reverse mortgage she had taken out her home forcing her family give the property horrifying think she was able give that away less than five years all the things she didn want she didn want nursing home said Bell Because she gave all her money away her worst nightmare happened She passed away last year Dozens complaints filed with various state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission about mailing scams like these echo what Bell found Often family members have filed these complaints after sorting through checks their loved ones had sent different scams and realizing that the common thread was the PacNet stamp the back One man told the Florida Attorney General Office that his wife called PacNet beg them stop the solicitations that had been hounding his year old father law who was suffering from Dementia Yet the mailings kept coming While PacNet doesn send out solicitations itself victims the scams processes payments for often don know where else turn get their money back make the letters stop What can done about PacNet wrote the agency saying his father law recently went through bankruptcy and was living off Social Security and small pension And just last year another woman wrote several pages the Florida Attorney General about her year old mother Ruby Helms She said Helms had been spending every cent her Social Security and Veteran benefits scams ultimately losing more than and cashing out retirement investments pawning her jewelry and going into serious debt obtained copies the checks and identified pattern that fees from significant number these differently named sweepstakes were deposited PACNET accounts she wrote the complaint The agency told that does not have any active investigations into PacNet first heard about PacNet while digging into the network behind million mail scam centering French psychic named Maria Duval This worldwide operation pumped out millions letters promising victims that psychic readings and predictions from Duval were the secret turning their lives around All they needed was send money The Duval scheme was shut down the earlier this year and criminal investigation ongoing PacNet was the company that deposited many these payments continuing even after clear warning from the North Dakota Attorney General according the Treasury Department But what didn know the time was that the Duval letters were just the beginning Founded more than years ago PacNet operates out nondescript highrise downtown Vancouver and claims one the industry leading payment processors letter from its attorney claimed its roster clients includes universities publishers and charities well marketing companies that advertise and sell goods and services internationally through printed media Internet commerce and mail But the wake our months long investigation into the Duval empire found scam after scam that used PacNet process payments Dominated promises huge winnings from clairvoyants and bogus prize and sweepstakes agencies these schemes have drawn angry rants from consumers for years Making matters more confusing for victims and their families the solicitations would often direct consumers make out checks three letter acronyms generic first names And the letters typically come from nondescript boxes and companies with ever changing rosters names making the schemes nearly impossible trace Many schemes were not just lambasted victims but scam alerts and warnings issued government agencies Others have had their mail seized keep predatory solicitations out the hands victims And found more than dozen examples from court and government records where schemes using PacNet process payments have been hit with government fraud lawsuits and shut down law enforcement resulting huge financial penalties criminal charges and even time behind bars Even the face our findings PacNet claims everything its power prevent fraud And while says this includes reviewing client marketing materials and cooperating with authorities soon wrongdoing identified acknowledges that does not necessarily see every mailing piece circulation especially when sometimes the case dishonest merchant takes affirmative steps mislead the company PacNet attorney said letter written CNNMoney June noted recent plea deal where former defendant mail fraud case said the operation misled PacNet and other service providers about the actual mailings being sent out the extent there have been isolated instances which PacNet clients have unbeknownst the Company misled PacNet and misused PacNet legitimate payment processing services support their own deceptive conduct directed consumers PacNet different than any bank credit card company other financial institution PacNet attorney said letter written CNNMoney June Yet some the schemes have come from serial con artists who have repeatedly had their operations shut down authorities Take Las Vegas fraudster Glen Burke who has been the target law enforcement actions for two decades and was permanently barred from telemarketing The Federal Trade Commission sued Burke alleging that ignored that ban and the government says that PacNet was processing payments for his schemes recently few years ago only stopping after the FTC stepped court declaration from the FTC case PacNet founder Rosanne Day acknowledged that PacNet had processed nearly million behalf Glen Burke since PacNet financial statement filed evidence shows that one point PacNet charged commission this was the case for all million processed PacNet would have taken around commissions the FTC case the agency shut down two different prize winning schemes allegedly run Burke one perpetrated mail the other phone Court documents include emails where Burke and his associates discuss trying avoid authorities and joke about jail time And letters seized from Burke office victims dire financial straits beg for the money they been promised While Burke claims was simply consultant the schemes PacNet itself said disbursed funds accordance with instructions from Burke and the federal government has found that Burke was the one calling the shots Burke was ultimately hit with million judgments for running these schemes currently appealing one these judgments And his attorney adamant that Burke being wrongfully targeted law enforcement and was not always the one charge like the government has said was PacNet attorney said the company has strengthened its compliance program the wake the Burke case adding additional screening measures This week Burke was hit with yet another action when and alleged conspirator were indicted counts mail fraud and other charges was arrested Postal inspectors and taken custody with Marshals Tuesday The Burke case isn the only time PacNet name has surfaced government fraud filings authorities have attempted shut down schemes using the company process payments All the way back for example government officials seized hundreds thousands dollars from PacNet accounts claiming the funds were illegal proceeds from foreign lottery solicitations settlement which the government said did not constitute admission proof PacNet wrongdoing PacNet agreed forfeit these proceeds the government and pledged never facilitate payments for this kind scheme again Just five years later Australian authorities discovered that PacNet had been the payment processor for different sweepstakes and lottery scams PacNet cooperated with the investigation and agreed refund Australian dollars victims these scams the time officials emphasized that none these scams would have been possible without way transfer cash from the victims the perpetrators all businesses providing cheque transfer services took appropriate steps monitor their customers activities for potential scams and then refused provide services the operators the life blood the scams would cut off the Australian consumer protection agency said For years PacNet has provided this life blood Using its services fraudsters have made their millions All while the victims little more than faceless names envelopes the scammers who descend upon them their final years life are left penniless Most stock quote data provided BATS Market indices are shown real time except for
